Is your team rebuilding your company's web app for the **5th** time? Is the company switching to React just after rebuilding the **whole** app with Angular? Are you tired of looking at the same DOM node hundreds of times? If that is the case, then that is unfortunate. Be still afraid of the scope explosion that is about to happen.

This little tool is designed to help differentiate differences in DOM nodes visually. So that developers won't have to strain their eyes so hard at looking at Chrome dev tools.

### Usage

1. Just copy two dom nodes you want to observe
2. Paste into respective textareas
3. Hit analyze and visualize your node
    - You can hover over to see individual characteristics of the DOM node
    - You can also click on them to make them as stickys

More features coming up soon!
